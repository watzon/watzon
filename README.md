### Hi, I'm Chris Watson ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer with a passion for open source, new technologies, and learning. If you're here, browsing my Github portfolio you'll probably notice a number of different languages in use, including lesser known ones like [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org), [Zig](https://ziglang.org), and [Nim](https://nim-lang.org). This is because I love experimenting with new technologies that have the possibility of improving my performance or general happiness as a developer.

I am always working on side projects in my free time. Here are a few that I'm especially proud of:

#### Paste69

Paste69 ([0x45.st](https://0x45.st)) is an ultra-simple API based paste bin heavily based on [0x0](https://git.0x0.st/mia/0x0), but written in Crystal.

#### Inkify

Inkify ([inkify.0x45.st](https://inkify.0x45.st)) is an API based code-to-image service similar to carbon.now.sh. It's written in Rust and entirely free to use.

#### Tourmaline

Tourmaline is a batteries (and kitchen sink) included framework for building Telegram bots with Crystal. It includes full support for the bot API, as well as a number of helpful abstractions, a FSM, menu builders, and more. You can learn more about it on the project's official website, https://tourmaline.dev.

#### Marionette

As with many of my personal projects, this one was written in Crystal. I tend to prefer Crystal for personal projects because of it's beautiful syntax, easy concurrency, and relative overall speed. Marionette is a browser automation tool written from the ground up to support just about everything that Selenium Webdriver does, but without the Java overhead. Check it out [here](https://github.com/watzon/marionette).

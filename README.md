### Hi, I'm Chris Watson ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer with a passion for open source, new technologies, and learning. If you're here, browsing my Github portfolio you'll probably notice a number of different languages in use, including lesser known ones like [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org), [Zig](https://ziglang.org), and [Nim](https://nim-lang.org). This is because I love experimenting with new technologies that have the possibility of improving my performance or general happiness as a developer.

I am currently employed by [Truvy](https://truvy.com), but I'm always working on side projects in my free time. Here are a few that I'm especially proud of:

#### Tourmaline

Tourmaline is a batteries (and kitchen sink) included framework for building Telegram bots with Crystal. It includes full support for the bot API, as well as a number of helpful abstractions, a FSM, menu builders, and more. You can learn more about it on the project's official website, https://tourmaline.dev.

#### Marionette

As with many of my personal projects, this one was written in Crystal. I tend to prefer Crystal for personal projects because of it's beautiful syntax, easy concurrency, and relative overall speed. Marionette is a browser automation tool written from the ground up to support just about everything that Selenium Webdriver does, but without the Java overhead. Check it out [here](https://github.com/watzon/marionette).

**More to come...**

Thanks for checking out my profile! If you find any of my projects useful, please consider [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/watzon)! I've spent thousands of hours on my open source projects, and every little contribution matters.
